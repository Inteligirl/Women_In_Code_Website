			<h2>Women who inspire me to keep on coding!</h2>
			<p>Below is a brief summary of each woman and why she is important to me. This was a really tough choice to only pick three. However for the sake of keeping this site short I wanted to narrow down the list. Some of these women are well known in the computing world and others maybe not as much. Each one has contributed to my desire to learn and inspired me to continue working towards my degree no matter how difficult it seems at times. I decided last year it was time for me to just stop going to work just for a paycheck. I want a job that I was happy doing. I was no longer content just doing work. I wanted to do what I have always loved and help others too!</p>
			<p>As Grace Hopper has said:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">
        <p>The most dangerous phrase in the language is, "We've always done it this way."</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a></p>

				Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong></p>

				<p>Excerpt from Wikipedia: "She was an American computer scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, invented the first compiler for a computer programming language and was one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages."</p>
				
				<h2>How I learned about her.</h2>
				
				<p>I learned the story of Grace Hopper through researching women's groups in computing. I came across the website for the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and learned the her story. Grace Hopper also has a conference named for her. According to Wikipedia, "The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. It is the worldâ€™s largest gathering of women in computing. The Grace Hopper Celebration, named after computer scientist Grace Hopper, is organized by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery.

				<p><strong>Una Kravets<br>
				Co-host of Toolsday Podcast</strong></p>
				<p>Photo credits: <a href="https://una.im/">Una.im</a> and <a href="http://css-weekly.com/issue-200/">CSS-weekly.com</a></p>
				
				<p>From Una's website: "I'm a front-end developer who loves to travel, listen to audiobooks, and do brush lettering. But you're probably here for some tech shenanigans. That's cool, I do those too. I co-host a podcast about tech tools calledToolsday, write code for a living on the Cloud Platform Team within IBM Design, and speak about CSS/Sass, web performance, Open Source, and experiments in visual development. I've started two Sass Meetups and promote designers in Open Source as a core member of the Open Design Foundation"</p>
				
				<h2>How I learned about her.</h2>
				<p>I discovered Una Kravets while looking for website development podcasts to listen to while I was driving. There weren't a lot of channels out there that I could find. However, I discovered a podcast called Toolsday which is described as "20-ish-minute podcast about the latest in tech tools, tips, and tricks on Tuesdays at 2!" It is hosted by Chris Dhanaraj and Una Kravets. I really enjoyed Una's opening songs that were tech themed versions of popular songs. Both hosts cover a wide range of topics and I really like the posts on development tools and how they work. Even though I'm not far enough in my studies to understand everthing they discuss, I enjoy researching the tools they cover.

				<p><strong>Reshma Saujani<br>
				Founder and CEO of Girls Who Code</strong></p>
				<p>Photo Credits: <a href="http://www.makers.com/reshma-saujani">Makers.com</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483131204/can-coding-help-girls-take-risks">NPR.org</a></p>
				
				<p>From Reshma Saujani's website: "the Founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology. Through its Summer Immersion Programs and Clubs, Girls Who Code is leading the movement to inspire, educate, and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities."</p>
				
				<h2>How I learned about her.</h2>
				<p>I don't recall specifically how I came arcoss this amazing woman. I do remember seeing her organization online as I too have a passion to bring code to girls in my city. I live in a rural area that does not offer mentors or STEM groups to inspire girls to persue and stay with STEM topics. I came across her TED talk on "Teaching girls bravery, not perfection." I nearly cried listening to her talk. I thought that's it,finally someone gets me! I struggle so hard to be perfect instead of just jumping in and trying to solve a problem. I'm a very independent woman and it's hard for me to just set aside my thoughts of "just wait for the right time" or "maybe I should learn more before I try this program" so that I feel more prepared. Now I try to look at a code problem and just go for it!
