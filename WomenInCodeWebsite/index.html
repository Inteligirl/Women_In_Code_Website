			<h2>What this site is about</h2>
			<p>This website was built as my final project for CGS1820.0M1: Web Auth 1. I decided to build a tribute page to the women who inspire me to keep on coding. The only active pages on this site for project purposes are women in code and learn to code.</p>
			<p>Here are the Final Project instructions.</p>

			<p>Design an entire website which must contain the following items but can contain anything else you want to add. The list below is the list of minimum requirements.</p>
			<ol>
			<li>The site must have three pages. Each page must link to the other two.</li>
			<li>You must use CSS styles for presentational aspects of your page. You should have an external (linked) style sheet for a consistent "look and feel" to the whole site but you can also use any combination of inline and embedded styles to modify specific items. The entire site should have one design theme. The color scheme should be reflected on all the pages unless there is a good reason for one page to deviate from the rest.</li>
			<li>The Page Title should tell the viewer what your site is about and what aspect of the site each page is about. The Page Titles on all the pages should relate to the subject of your site.</li>
			<li>The CSS box model should be used to control the spacing between elements on your pages and to display any borders or backgrounds.</li>
			<li>The site must use a consistent navigation scheme.</li>
			<li>At least one page should have a 2-column or 3-column layout.</li>
			<li>Your page should use Responsive Web Design, as described in Chapter 8.</li>
			<li>Your site should have at least one image with an image swap, map, and/or rollover. Be sure to use free images if you get images from the web and give credit where credit is due! The credit should include a link to the site where you found the image as well as the aritist or photographer's name, if available The same, of course, is true for any information you copy from another website.</li>
			<li>There must be a minimum of two lists: an ordered or unordered list and a description list.</li>
			<li>There must be at least one table somewhere in the site.</li>
			<li>If there are misspellings and/or grammar mistakes in your text, you will lose points. We are at the point of becoming professional web designers and nothing makes a web page look more amateur than misspellings and poor grammar!</li>
